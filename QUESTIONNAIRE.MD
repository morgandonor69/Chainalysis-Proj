# QUESTIONAIRE ANSWERS
  1. A few choices that I made that were suboptimal were my grabbing of the prices directly from the crypto arrays that I created. For some reason, when I directly accessed them, the prices were printing twice. To fix this, I created new arrays for the prices, and only accessed the first element. This was not great in terms of having the cleanest code, but it was the quickest fix I could think of while being pressed for time.
  
  2. I do not think this was overdesigned. I did it in about two days, and I was unable to dress it up completely with other css components. I believe it gets the job done that was asked in the assignment, while also showing my ability to easily pull from different API's and showcase their data.
  
  3. I would not make any changes as I believe my solution would work.

  4. I would have done more CSS to format the site better, as well as checking other sites to see if their API's were able to be accessed easier. These two sites are the two crypto sites I use most often, so that is why I decided on using them.
